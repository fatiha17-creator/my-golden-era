    <p><em>When I was 20s...</em><br>
    I was wondering—<br>
    Who would wanna spend his life with me, who would accept me, who wanna build a future together, chase our dreams, face problems side by side, and stay when things get hard?</p>

    <p>He really came to my world,<br>
    bringing his light, his love.<br>
    We hold our hands tight.<br>
    We liked each other.<br>
    We fell in love.</p>

    <p>We made our days feel like two birds,<br>
    flying high—seeing the world,<br>
    painting our lives with colors on the clouds.</p>

    <p><strong>Thank you for loving me.</strong><br>
    I’ve become the luckiest person in the world.</p>
